# Detection of Cyberbullying on Social Media Using Machine Learning
Cyberbullying, a pervasive issue on the internet, adversely impacts both teenagers and adults, often leading to tragic outcomes such as suicides and depression. To address this concern, our project utilizes data encompassing two distinct forms of cyberbullying: hate speech tweets sourced from Twitter and comments featuring personal attacks from Wikipedia forums. Our primary objective is to construct a model employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to effectively detect instances of cyberbullying within textual data. Specifically, we adopt the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method for classification. By employing various techniques for feature extraction and classifiers, we aim to identify the most optimal approach. Subsequently, our classification process hinges on selected terms, culminating in the system's output which indicates whether a given text message from the dataset exhibits bullying behavior or not.
This model consists of 2 codes one is the model which shows the aaccuracy of models and the other is used to predict if cybersecurity or not.
